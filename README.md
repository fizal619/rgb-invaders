# rgb-invaders

Kill the invaders in order to fill the color bars! Try to get as close as possible to make the goal color. Or better yet, a perfect score!

## The Game

Putting a personal mathematical twist on the classic space invaders i loved growing up. As you kill the invaders, their respective colors would increment the comparable colorbar/meter. <br>
Try as best you can to match the goal color that is randomly generated, or just best your last score. Scoring is the combined RGB difference between your current color and the goal color. **THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO ZERO THE BETTER.** <br>

## User Stories
* As a user I would like to move the spaceship.
* As a user I would like to see my score in real time. 
* As a user I would like to see the color bar move up and down as I score. 
* As a user I would like to shoot the aliens to score. 

Bonus Features:

* If possible add a live timer to the game.
* As a user I would like to share my score with my friends on facebook.

Shoutout to Trevor Preston and [this link](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4796743/random-position-of-divs-in-javascript) for helping me understand random element spawning. <br>
I also got the function for identifying collisions from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5419134/how-to-detect-if-two-divs-touch-with-jquery). <br>
