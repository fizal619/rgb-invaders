# rgb-invaders

Kill the invaders in order to fill the color bars! Try to get as close as possible to make the goal color. Or better yet, a perfect score!

## The Game

As you kill the invaders, their respective colors would increment the comparable colorbar/meter. <br>
Every spawns for 2 seconds on the board randomly and you have to hit the coressponding button for that alien to kill them. There can be anywhere betweeen 2 and 8 aliens on the board at once.<br>
Try as best you can to match the goal color that is randomly generated, or just best your last score. Scoring is the combined *RGB* difference between your current color and the goal color. **THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO ZERO THE BETTER.** <br>
But remember, if you put too much of one color, you lose!
