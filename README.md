# rgb-invaders

Kill the invaders in order to fill the color bars! Try to get as close as possible to make the goal color. Or better yet, a perfect score!

## The Game

Putting a personal mathematical twist on the classic space invaders i loved growing up. As you kill the invaders, their respective colors would increment the comparable colorbar/meter. <br>
Try as best you can to match the goal color that is randomly generated, or just best your last score. Scoring is the combined RGB difference between your current color and the goal color. **THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO ZERO THE BETTER.** <br>

## Some of the Important Notes:
[Melonjs](http://melonjs.org/) is used as the game library, to make it easier to deal with the physics and collisions. <br>
